I am a senior machine learning engineer at ByteFuse, a new startup focusing on projecting multiple modalities into a shared euclidian space. Doing this, we aim to give all industries the capability to “search” over their data with our easy to use API and model heads. 

Along with this, I am also doing my PhD with [Herman Kamper](https://www.kamperh.com/) and the [LSL group](https://www.kamperh.com/people/) at Stellenbosch University. My area of research is in multimodal systems, specifically few shot learning systems involving speech. I received my BEng (Electronic) from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/) and my MSc from the [University of Cape Town](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/). 

Oh yeah, I also love cats, mountain biking and pasta.
