I am the technical lead for representation learning at [ByteFuse AI](https://bytefuse.ai), a new startup focusing on developing multimodal algorithms applied to search and  optimisation tasks. I also drive the research goals and lead the Llama (internship) programme.

In addition, I am pursuing a PhD at Stellenbosch University with [Herman Kamper](https://www.kamperh.com/) and the [LSL group](https://www.kamperh.com/people/). My area of research is in multimodal meta-learning, with a specific focus on few-shot continual learning. When not working on this, I also try and find out why and how networks generalise. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics) degree from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/) and a MSc from the [University of Cape Town](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/).

I also love cats, mountain biking, and eating pasta.
