I am a senior machine learning engineer at [ByteFuse](https://bytefuse.ai/), a new startup specializing in multimodal representation learning. Using this expertise , we will be able to enable all sectors to "search" their data using our simple-to-use API and model heads.

<!-- In addition, I am pursuing a PhD at Stellenbosch University with [Herman Kamper](https://www.kamperh.com/) and the [LSL group](https://www.kamperh.com/people/). My research interests are around few-shot multimodal systems, with a focus on meta-learning and neurosymbolic approaches.  -->
I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics) degree from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/) and a MSc from the [University of Cape Town](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/).

I also love cats, mountain biking, and eating pasta.
