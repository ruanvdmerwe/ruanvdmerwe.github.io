I am co-founder and technical lead for representation learning at [ByteFuse AI](https://bytefuse.ai). I also drive the research goals and lead the Llama (internship) programme.

Along with this, I am also an active researcher in the fields of meta-learning, continual learning, LLM knowledge extractions and neural network generalisation. 

 I can claim that I am officially an university dropout that pursued a company, and I have an unhealthy obsession with cats and llamas.
