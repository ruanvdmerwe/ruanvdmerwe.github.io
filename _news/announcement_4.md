I presented a [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ByteFuse/indabax-2021/blob/main/multimodal-search/bytefuse_indabax_multimodal_search_intro.ipynb) on multimodal vector search as well as [introducing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIvV1qw94FE&t=392) the multimodal system we developed at [ByteFuse](https://bytefuse.ai/) at one of the [IndabaX](https://indabax.co.za/) roadshow events.
